# Project Overview
This project is a simulation of a complete enterprise style IT support environment using VirtualeBox, Windows Server, and Windows 11 clients. The goal was to demonstrate hands-on skills relevant to IT Support, Help Desk, and Junior System Administration roles, including:

- Active Directory Deployment
- DNS & Networking
- User & Group Management
- Group Policy (GPO) configuration
- Security practices
- Powershell automation
- Realistic troubleshooting workflows

This environment mirrors what real companies use and serves as a practical showcase of technical ability, documentation skills, and problem-solving.
